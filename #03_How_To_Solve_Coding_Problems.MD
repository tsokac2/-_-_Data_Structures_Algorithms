### <a name="coding-q"> Exercise: Coding Interview - Thought Steps</a>

#### Challenge
Given 2 arrays, create a function that lets a user know (true/false) whether these two arrays contain any common items.

#### Step By Step through a problem

#### 1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the key points at the top (i.e., sorted array).
    - Make sure you have all the details.
    - Show how organized you are.

For Example:
- ``const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'i'];``

**Should return**: ``false`` -  because there is nothing common between these 2 arrays.

- ``const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'x'];``

**Should return**: ``true`` - because the item `'x'` is present in `array1` and `array2`.

#### 2. Make sure you double-check:
    - What are the inputs?
    - What are the outputs?

In this case, we have:
- 2 input parameters are always `arrays`.
- As a result, we always want to return `true` or `false`.

**NOTE**: This is a very important step; don't jump into the coding right away!

#### 3. What is the most important value of the problem?
- Do you have time, space, and memory, etc.?
- What is the main goal?

You can ask, "How large the array is going to be." If it's a constant array, we don't have to worry about Time Complexity, Space Complexity, and Big O.
- Is Time Complexity more important?
- Is Space Complexity more important?

#### 4. Don't be annoying and ask too many questions.

#### 5. Start with the naive/brute force(easy solution) approach. The easiest way to solve the problem!
- The first thing that comes to mind.
- It shows that you're able to think well and critically (you don't need to write this code, just speak about it).

**Easy solution**:
So immediately this looks like we're comparing two different arrays and we're going to have two ``for`` loops, one nested on top of each other.

And right away we know that that's a Big O:``O(n^2)``.

The important thing is that you let the interviewer know that this is the brute force or the easy.

**Easy/Brute solution:**
```
const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];
const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'i'];

const containsCommonItems = (arr1, arr2) => {
    for(let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
        for(let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++){
            if(arr1[i] === arr2[j]){
                return true;
            }
        }
    }
    return false;
}

containsCommonItems(array1, array2);
```
The Big O is: ``` O(a*b)``` - how can we make this faster?

We know that:
- Iterating through half a collection is still ``O(n)``
- Two separate collections: ``O(a*b)``

#### 6. Tell them why this approach is not the best?
- Two nested ``for`` loops - try to avoid these solutions.
- ``O(n^2)`` or higher.
- Code is not readable.

#### 7. Walk through your approach, comment things and see where you may be able to break things.
- Any repetition, bottlencks like ``O(n^2)``, or unnecessary work?
- Did you use all the information the interviewer gave you?
- Bottleneck is the part of the code with the biggest Big O. **Focus on that**.
- You might not see a solution right away, and that is because you need to practice a few of these problems to understand a common pattern.

**Let's try different solution** - to improve a Time Complexity and change the Big O:
Most common patern in coding interviews:
- Create a new object for the first ``array1`` to store all the array items.

#### 8. Before you start coding, walk through your code and write down the steps you are going to follow.

```
function containsCommonItem2(arr1, arr2) {

  // 1 - loop through first array and create object where properties === items in the array

  // 2 - loop through second array and check if item in second array exists on created object. 
}
```

**Half-way Summary of the excercise:**

- Although we haven't given a clear solution, we've been talking about how we solve the problem.
- The interviewer sees how we think, sees what steps we take
- Sees that we're making smart, critical decisions to go from understanding the problem to solving the problem in a naive way
- Understanding why this might not be the best way, and then start to think about possible solutions.
- And the beauty of this approach is that no matter whether we get this part correct, maybe our assumptions are wrong and we can't do this.
- We're showing the interviewer that we're thinking through a problem and we're making small, logical steps towards a solution.
- And this is a lot better than just coding right away, trying a solution and see if you get it right or wrong.
- An interviewer is going to have a good understanding of your abilities and your thought process this way, and these are the type of people that they want to hire.

#### 9. Modularize your code from the very beginning.
- Break up your code into beautiful small pieces and add just comments if you need to.


#### 10. Start actually writing your code now
- Keep in mind that the more you prepare and understand what you need to code, the better the whiteboard will go.
- So never start a whiteboard interview not being sure of how things are going to work out.
- That is a recipe for disaster.
- Keep in mind:
    - A lot of interviews ask questions that you won't be able to fully answer on time.
- So think:
    - What can I show to demonstrate that I can do this and am better than other coders?
- Break things up into functions (if you can't remember a method, just make up a function, and you will at least have it there.)
- Write something, and start with the easy part.

**New code solution:**
```
const containsCommonItem = (arr1, arr2) => {

// #1 - loop through first array and create object where properties === items in the array

    let map = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++){
        if(!map[arr1[i]]){
            const item = arr1[i];
            map[item] = true;
        }
    }

// #2 - loop through second array and check if item in second array exists on created object

    for (let j = 0; j < arr2.length; j++){
        if(map[arr2[j]]){
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
console.log(containsCommonItem(array1, array2));
```

#### 11. Think about error checks and how you can break this code.
- Never make assumptions about the input.
- Assume people are trying to break your code and that Darth Vader is using your function.
- How will you safeguard it?
- Always check for false inputs that you don't want.
- Here is a trick:
    - Comment in the code, the checks thay you want to do... write the function, then tell the interviewer that you would write tests now to make your functions fail (but you won't need to actually write the tests).

Test case to break your code:

##### CASE 1:
- ``const array1 = [null, 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', null, 'i'];`` 
``// true``

##### CASE 2:
- ``const array1 = [[], 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'i'];``
``// false``

##### CASE 3:
- ``const array1 = [1, 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', 'y', 1];``
``// true``

Questions for the interviewer:
 - Can we assume always 2 parameters in functions - always 2 arrays?
 - You can suggest to the interviewer if this is real-world scenario that wrting additional Unit tests will test the function.

**NOTE:** Since this solution is writen in JavaScript - Object properties are turned into ``strings`` when created.

#### 12. Don't use bad/confusing names like ``i`` and ``j``
- Write code that reads well.

### Section Summary

Solving coding problems is a fundamental skill for any programmer. It requires a combination of problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach coding problems:

#### Understand the problem statement:
- Read the problem carefully and make sure you fully comprehend the requirements.
- Identify the input and output of the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Try to visualize the expected solution.

#### Choose the right data structure and algorithm:
- Analyze the problem and determine the most appropriate data structure to store and organize the data.
- Select the most suitable algorithm to solve the problem efficiently.
- Consider the time and space complexity of different algorithms to choose the most performant one.

#### Write pseudocode:
- Before diving into actual code, express the solution in pseudocode, which is a high-level, English-like description of the algorithm.
- Pseudocode helps you clarify your thoughts, identify potential issues, and avoid coding errors.
- It also serves as a reference point for translating the algorithm into the chosen programming language.

#### Implement the solution:
- Start coding the solution in your chosen programming language.
- Use clear and concise code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions.
- Document your code with comments to explain the purpose of each section.

#### Test your solution:
- Write test cases to thoroughly validate the correctness of your solution.
- Test the code with various input values, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
- Use automated testing frameworks to automate the testing process.
- Analyze the test results to identify and fix any errors or bugs.

#### Optimize and refactor:
- Once the code is working correctly, analyze its performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Optimize the algorithm to reduce its time and space complexity.
- Refactor the code to improve its readability, maintainability, and code quality.

#### Seek help and resources:
- Don't hesitate to ask for help from experienced programmers or online communities if you get stuck.
- Utilize online resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and code repositories, to learn from others.
- Practice regularly and solve a variety of problems to improve your problem-solving skills.

Remember, problem-solving is a skill that develops over time with practice and experience. Don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges along the way. Keep learning, practicing, and refining your approach, and you'll become a more proficient problem solver and programmer.
