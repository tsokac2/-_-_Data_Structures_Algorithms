### Resume Resources
I recommend you read through **[this article](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/11/25/how-to-write-an-effective-developer-resume-advice-from-a-hiring-manager/)** which gives some additional advice on how to make sure your resume send the right message and it is affective as possible.

### Github Master
Don't have a good Github history? 

Don't worry! 

If you are looking to add a little flare to your Github profile, which a lot of recruiters check, you can try using this tool: https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti

Heads up! 

Some people have had a hard time following the gitfiti instructions/readme. For this reason, I have also included an easier alternative that you can use: https://github.com/ZachSaucier/github-calendar-customizer

It will generate a file for you full of git commands which you will be able to run and design your Github history whichever way you want. Make sure you read the instructions and understand what it does!

If you want to make your Github profile stand out, then here is a **[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktN5tDfQ_g8)** that walks you through how to setup a professional and visually appealing README. Check it out!
