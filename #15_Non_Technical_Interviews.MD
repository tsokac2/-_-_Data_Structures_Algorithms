### During The Interview

**Mindset**:

This is not your only chance!

You see, the biggest mistake that we made going into an interview is that, well, thinking that this is your only chance.

The way you walk into an interview is to walk in knowing that you have many other opportunities.

So first and foremost, treat everything as a learning experience.

Your goal is to enter the room with a lot of energy, being happy, excited to be there.

And this is a classic psychological technique where humans, when we interact with each other, we match each other's energy and energy level.

Can you do the job? Answer hard tech questions.

Can I work with you?

Are you going to improve?

#### 4 Heroes

You see, before you enter the interview, you have to have somewhere between 2 to 4 stories prepared that I call the four heroes.

1. Technical experienc 
- story about your tech experience
- your project, portfolio

2. Success
- You want to have some sort of story that shows you that you're a successful person, not a person that

Did you maybe start a little app that turned out to be quite successful and it got a lot of users.

Maybe your past job, you got promoted to a senior level position - tranig junior staff


3. Leadership
- You want to have some sort of story that shows you that you're a successful person, not a person that never succeeds in any job.

The next one is leadership.

Are you the type of person that tak

4. Challenge

And challenge is they want to hear a story of you going through some really challenging things, maybe a challenging technical problem that you had on a project and how you overcame it because you're a type of person that when presented with something that is really difficult, that has no clear solution,

### <a name="yourself">Tell Me About Yourself?</a>

You also want to slightly discuss maybe your past projects, your past companies, so that you get asked

questions about these projects or past companies by the interviewer.

Because keep in mind, the interviewer is going to ask follow up questions based on this.

And when you talk about yourself, maybe it's interesting that you were an origami master five years

ago, but it might not matter to the interviewer.


Prepare story just keep it short and to the point, but make sure you stand out from the crowd.

Well, I got really interested in coding a couple of years back when I would start this small little

side businesses, and I would hire developers and designers to build a website or an app for me.

And it was always a black box where I would pay this developer money and they will come back with a

product that I was never fully satisfied for.

So I started teaching myself how to code because I wanted to know how this black box works.

And the more I learned, the more I learned.

I became really interested, really engulfed in the programming landscape.

### <a name="why">Why Us?</a>

![Why Us](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/45.JPG)

Good answer example:

Well, you know, I've been researching your company for a while, and I noticed that you're doing some

work on X, and I myself have done some work in the past similar to this, and this is what I learned

about it.

And then you can go on with that, and then you can say something along the lines of.

And I think the problem of X is really interesting, and I think it's something that I can add value

to but also learn and become better at.

### <a name="problem">Tell Me About A Problem You Have Solved</a>

Now with these type of questions, we want to use something called the SA method as a R method that

SAR - situation, action and result.

Is situation, action and result.

There's one last thing, and that is you're going to get a variation of this question, such as tell

me about an interesting project you've worked on, and they're very similar.
