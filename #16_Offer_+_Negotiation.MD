### Handling Rejection

You see winners and people that are good at interviewing just get up after a rejection and go on and keep swinging.

Like I said before, if you fail ten times, try ten times more.

All you need is that one success.

### Negotiation 101

![]()

If you get asked, what salary do you want in an interview, what do you say?

**Answer** - Well, I know that the average software developer in Silicon Valley, let's say I'm applying there,

makes roughly 120,000 a year.


I didn't actually answer their question and say, Well, I want 90,000 per year.

All I did was do something called anchoring where I tell them, This is where we want our conversation

to start.

I want the conversation to start 


Instead, you want to keep the conversation going by giving something like an industry average and make it clear that you're merely starting the negotiation here and not ending it.



**Give Reason for everything**

For example, if somebody gives you an offer and this is something that we'll talk in later on videos,it says, hey, we are going to offer you 80,000 a year.

What do you think?

Are you in or are you out?


ANSWER: 

That's very generous and I'm very excited potentially working with your company.

However, this is a big family decision and I'm looking to work at a company for many years, so I would like to discuss this with my wife or my partner and have some time to make sure that this is something we are both comfortable with.



**Always negotiate**

Negotiation is finding a balance between what two people want.


**Be positive**

Negotiating doesn't mean being mean.

It's the exact opposite.

You want to explore the situations that are available to you, and negotiations are win win situations.

**Have stakes**

Steaks means you have to have something on the line if there's no risk.

And you knew for sure that the other side would sign a contract or accept the salary, then what incentive do they have to offer you more?
