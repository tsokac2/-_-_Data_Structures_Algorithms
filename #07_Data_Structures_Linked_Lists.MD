### <a name="linked-lists">What Is A Linked List?</a>

A linked list is a data structure used in computer science to organize and store data. 

It consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence. 

Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion or removal of elements at any position within the list.

### <a name="why-linked-lists">Why Linked Lists?</a>

- **Dynamic Size:** Unlike arrays, linked lists can dynamically adjust their size during runtime.

- **Efficient Insertions and Deletions**: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is more efficient than in an array, especially when dealing with large datasets.

- **No Contiguous Memory Requirement**: Linked lists do not require contiguous memory locations, allowing for more efficient memory utilization.

- **Easy to Implement Certain Algorithms**: Some algorithms, like certain graph algorithms, are more naturally implemented with linked lists.

- **Simplifying Memory Management**: Memory can be allocated and deallocated more dynamically in linked lists compared to arrays.
