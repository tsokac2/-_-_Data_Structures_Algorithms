### <a name="mindset">During The Interview - Mindset</a>

This is not your only chance!

One of the most significant mistakes people make when going into an interview is believing that it's their only opportunity. Instead, approach interviews with the understanding that you have numerous other chances.

The key to a successful interview is to treat it as a learning experience. Approach the situation with enthusiasm, energy, and a genuine excitement to be there.

Employ a classic psychological technique where human interactions involve matching each other's energy and level. By entering the room with positivity, you create a more favorable impression.

#### 4 Heroes - Address fundamental questions during the interview:

1. **Can you do the job?**

- Be prepared to answer challenging technical questions related to your experience, projects, and portfolio.

2. **Can I work with you?**

- Showcase success stories that highlight your achievements, such as developing a successful app or earning a promotion to a senior position in a previous job, including training junior staff.

3. **Are you going to improve?**

- Demonstrate leadership qualities with stories that emphasize your ability to succeed and improve in various roles.

4. **Challenge**

- Share a story of overcoming a significant challenge, perhaps a complex technical problem in a project. Highlight your problem-solving skills, showcasing your ability to tackle difficult situations with no clear solution.

### <a name="yourself">Tell Me About Yourself?</a>

![Tell Me About Yourself](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/44.JPG)


It's also beneficial to briefly touch upon your past projects and previous roles during the interview. This can prompt the interviewer to inquire further about these experiences. 

Keep in mind that the interviewer is likely to ask follow-up questions based on the information you provide.

While sharing about yourself, consider that certain details, like being an origami master five years ago, may be intriguing but might not be relevant to the interviewer.

When preparing your narrative, aim for brevity while ensuring it remains impactful to distinguish yourself from other candidates.

Personally, my interest in coding deepened a couple of years ago when I ventured into small side businesses. In those ventures, I would enlist developers and designers to create websites or apps for me. 

However, the process felt like a black box; I would invest money, and the outcome often fell short of my expectations. To demystify this, I took the initiative to learn coding. The more I delved into it, the more engrossed I became in the programming landscape.

### <a name="why">Why Us?</a>

![Why Us](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/45.JPG)

Good answer example:

Well, you know, I've been researching your company for a while, and I noticed that you're doing some

work on X, and I myself have done some work in the past similar to this, and this is what I learned

about it.

And then you can go on with that, and then you can say something along the lines of.

And I think the problem of X is really interesting, and I think it's something that I can add value

to but also learn and become better at.

### <a name="problem">Tell Me About A Problem You Have Solved</a>

![Tell Me About A Problem You Have Solved](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/46.JPG)

Now with these type of questions, we want to use something called the SA method as a R method that

SAR - situation, action and result.

Is situation, action and result.

There's one last thing, and that is you're going to get a variation of this question, such as tell

me about an interesting project you've worked on, and they're very similar.

### <a name="weakness">What Is Your Biggest Weakness</a>

![weakness](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/48.JPG)

Example:

Maybe say something along the lines of Sometimes when there's a problem, I get straight into coding without really thinking about the problem.

And as I'm typing, as I'm typing, I realize that perhaps I should have waited, planned out how I should write my code, how it should be structured, what problem am I really solving before I start just coding it?


So lately I've taken the time to make sure that I write pseudocode first.

Just commenting out the steps that I want to take.

While my assumptions are what my inputs are and from there, write out the steps that I want my code

to take before I actually dive into code.

### <a name="questions">Any Questions For Us?</a>

![Any Questions For Us](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/49.JPG)

What is the greatest mistake you made in the first month of the job and what did you do?

Where do you see this company going in the next three years?

Why did you join this company again?

Have you seen your skills grow in the past year?

What they wish somebody told them when they just started the job of this company?

### Secret Weapon

![Secret Weapon](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/50.JPG)

1. **The first one is simplicity over complexity.**

Instead, you focused on readable code because you understood that working in a team means making sure

that the code is readable and maintainable long after you've written it.

This is a great thing to point out in an interview because it's rare for somebody to understand this

with only a few years of experience.

2. **Premature optimization is the root of all evil.**

3. **Overall goal and not be myopic.**

Myopic means you're just very narrowly focused on one thing.

4. **Complain about clients ugly code, maybe coworkers that can get frustrating.**

5. **No ego**

It is a big problem for companies, but if you're the type of coder that likes getting feedback, that

takes constructive criticism and understands that there's no ego here.

We work as a team, there's no individual, and that the overall goal of the company or project is what matters.

And you're able to demonstrate that that immediately is a big sell or it makes you a very valuable developer.

### After The Interview

Well, first off, you want to thank your recruiter or the interviewer and you want to sound excited.

And you also want to ask them when you should expect to hear back from them so that you have some sort of a timeline of when the decision is going to be made, whether to give you the job or to do another interview.


![Thank you for your time](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/51.JPG)


Thank you for your time.

I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I want to say one last thing.

There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.

However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless developers with ambition to learn.

It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong.

The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.

It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today, but the one thing that you can

guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her

skill every day, play nicely with all the other developers at the company and isn't so narrow minded

and problem solving that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

When you hire me, you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.

You don't have to extinguish fires.

And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.

I can guarantee that I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can

grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

And I've chosen this company specific for that reason.

And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have

an impact and propel your career.

I am at the stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you.

So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.

All right.

That was it.

Now, this may sound a little intense, but who would you hire?
