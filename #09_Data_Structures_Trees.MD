### Trees Introduction

Trees are a non-linear data structure that represents hierarchical data. They consist of nodes connected by edges. 

Each node can have zero or more child nodes, and each child node has exactly one parent node, except for the root node, which has no parent.

**Here are some of the key characteristics of trees**:

- **Hierarchical structure**: Trees organize data in a hierarchical manner, with each node representing a level in the hierarchy.

- **Directed edges**: The edges that connect nodes in a tree are directed, meaning that they point from a parent node to its child nodes. This ensures that there is a single path between any two nodes in the tree.

- **No cycles**: Trees do not contain any cycles or loops. This means that there is no path from a node back to itself or to any of its ancestors.

Trees are a versatile and powerful data structure that can be used for a variety of tasks, including:

- **Searching**: Trees can be efficiently searched to find a particular node or value.

- **Insertion**: New nodes can be easily inserted into trees without disrupting the existing structure.

- **Deletion**: Nodes can be deleted from trees efficiently, and the resulting tree remains well-structured.

- **Traversal**: Trees can be traversed in different ways, such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order, to visit each node once and only once.
