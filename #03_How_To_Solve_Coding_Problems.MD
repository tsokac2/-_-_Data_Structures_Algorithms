### <a name="coding-q"> Exercise: Coding Interview - Thought Steps</a>

#### Challenge
Given 2 arrays, create a function that let's a user know (true/false) whether these two arrays contain any common items

#### Step By Step through a problem

#### 1. When the interviewer says the question, write down the key points at the top (i.e. sorted array).
    - Make sure you have all the details.
    - Show how organized you are.

For Example:
- ``const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'i'];``

**Should return**: ``false`` - because there is nothing common betwen these 2 arrays.

- ``const array1 = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'x'];``
- ``const array2 = ['z', 'y', 'x'];``

**Should return**: ``true`` - because item ``'x'`` is present in ``array1`` and ``array2``.

#### 2. Make sure you double check:
    - What are the inputs?
    - What are the outputs?

### Section Summary

Solving coding problems is a fundamental skill for any programmer. It requires a combination of problem-solving, critical thinking, and creativity. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach coding problems:

#### Understand the problem statement:
- Read the problem carefully and make sure you fully comprehend the requirements.
- Identify the input and output of the problem.
- Break down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks.
- Try to visualize the expected solution.

#### Choose the right data structure and algorithm:
- Analyze the problem and determine the most appropriate data structure to store and organize the data.
- Select the most suitable algorithm to solve the problem efficiently.
- Consider the time and space complexity of different algorithms to choose the most performant one.

#### Write pseudocode:
- Before diving into actual code, express the solution in pseudocode, which is a high-level, English-like description of the algorithm.
- Pseudocode helps you clarify your thoughts, identify potential issues, and avoid coding errors.
- It also serves as a reference point for translating the algorithm into the chosen programming language.

#### Implement the solution:
- Start coding the solution in your chosen programming language.
- Use clear and concise code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable functions.
- Document your code with comments to explain the purpose of each section.

#### Test your solution:
- Write test cases to thoroughly validate the correctness of your solution.
- Test the code with various input values, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
- Use automated testing frameworks to automate the testing process.
- Analyze the test results to identify and fix any errors or bugs.

#### Optimize and refactor:
- Once the code is working correctly, analyze its performance and identify areas for improvement.
- Optimize the algorithm to reduce its time and space complexity.
- Refactor the code to improve its readability, maintainability, and code quality.

#### Seek help and resources:
- Don't hesitate to ask for help from experienced programmers or online communities if you get stuck.
- Utilize online resources, such as documentation, tutorials, and code repositories, to learn from others.
- Practice regularly and solve a variety of problems to improve your problem-solving skills.

Remember, problem-solving is a skill that develops over time with practice and experience. Don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges along the way. Keep learning, practicing, and refining your approach, and you'll become a more proficient problem solver and programmer.
