Sorting algorithms are fundamental in computer science and play a crucial role in various applications. 

Here are some commonly used sorting algorithms and examples of tech companies that may use them:


**Bubble Sort**:
- **Description**: Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Tech Companies**: While less common in large-scale applications, Bubble Sort might be used in smaller-scale systems or educational contexts.

**Insertion Sort**:
- **Description**: Insertion Sort builds the sorted array one element at a time by repeatedly taking elements from the input data and inserting them into their correct position.
- **Tech Companies**: Amazon and Oracle might use Insertion Sort for small datasets or in scenarios where simplicity is prioritized.

**Selection Sort**:
- **Description**: Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part of the array and putting it at the beginning. 

**Mergesort**:
- **Description**: Heapsort uses a binary heap data structure to build a sorted array in-place.
- **Tech Companies**: Apple and Amazon may use Heapsort for its constant space complexity.

**Quicksort**:
- **Description**: Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that partitions an array and recursively sorts sub-arrays.
- **Tech Companies**: Google, LinkedIn, and Microsoft often use Quicksort due to its efficiency on average.
