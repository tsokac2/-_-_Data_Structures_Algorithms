### Arrays Introduction
- In ``JavaScript``, hash tables are commonly referred to as ``"objects"`` or "associative arrays."
- In ``Python``, hash tables are implemented using a built-in data type called a ``"dictionary."``
- In ``Java``, the equivalent of hash tables is provided by the ``HashMap class``, which is part of the Java Collections Framework. 
- In ``Ruby``, hash tables are typically referred to as ``"Hash"`` or ``"Hashes."``

### Hash Function

A Hash Function is a mathematical function that takes data of any size and produces a fixed-size output. This output is called a hash value, hash code, digest, or simply a hash. 

Hash functions are used in a variety of applications, including:

- **Data storage and retrieval**: Hash functions are used to index data in hash tables, which are a type of data structure that allows for fast and efficient searching and retrieval of data.
- **File integrity checking**: Hash functions can be used to create digital signatures that can be used to verify that a file has not been tampered with.
- **Password storage**: Hash functions can be used to store passwords securely without storing the actual password text.
