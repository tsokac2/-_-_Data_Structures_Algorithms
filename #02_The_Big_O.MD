### Big O Cheatsheet

**Big O notation** is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of time and space. 

It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the function that represents the algorithm's efficiency. 

In simpler terms, it helps us analyze how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm scale with the input size.
