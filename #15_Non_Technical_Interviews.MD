### <a name="mindset">During The Interview - Mindset</a>

This is not your only chance!

One of the most significant mistakes people make when going into an interview is believing that it's their only opportunity. Instead, approach interviews with the understanding that you have numerous other chances.

The key to a successful interview is to treat it as a learning experience. Approach the situation with enthusiasm, energy, and a genuine excitement to be there.

Employ a classic psychological technique where human interactions involve matching each other's energy and level. By entering the room with positivity, you create a more favorable impression.

#### 4 Heroes - Address fundamental questions during the interview:

1. **Can you do the job?**

- Be prepared to answer challenging technical questions related to your experience, projects, and portfolio.

2. **Can I work with you?**

- Showcase success stories that highlight your achievements, such as developing a successful app or earning a promotion to a senior position in a previous job, including training junior staff.

3. **Are you going to improve?**

- Demonstrate leadership qualities with stories that emphasize your ability to succeed and improve in various roles.

4. **Challenge**

- Share a story of overcoming a significant challenge, perhaps a complex technical problem in a project. Highlight your problem-solving skills, showcasing your ability to tackle difficult situations with no clear solution.

### <a name="yourself">Tell Me About Yourself?</a>

![Tell Me About Yourself](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/44.JPG)


It's also beneficial to briefly touch upon your past projects and previous roles during the interview. This can prompt the interviewer to inquire further about these experiences. 

Keep in mind that the interviewer is likely to ask follow-up questions based on the information you provide.

While sharing about yourself, consider that certain details, like being an origami master five years ago, may be intriguing but might not be relevant to the interviewer.

When preparing your narrative, aim for brevity while ensuring it remains impactful to distinguish yourself from other candidates.

Personally, my interest in coding deepened a couple of years ago when I ventured into small side businesses. In those ventures, I would enlist developers and designers to create websites or apps for me. 

However, the process felt like a black box; I would invest money, and the outcome often fell short of my expectations. To demystify this, I took the initiative to learn coding. The more I delved into it, the more engrossed I became in the programming landscape.

### <a name="why">Why Us?</a>

![Why Us](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/45.JPG)

**Good answer example**:

Well, you know, I've been researching your company for a while, and I noticed that you're doing some work on X, and I myself have done some work in the past similar to this, and this is what I learned about it.

And then you can go on with that, and then you can say something along the lines of.

And I think the problem of X is really interesting, and I think it's something that I can add value to but also learn and become better at.

### <a name="problem">Tell Me About A Problem You Have Solved</a>

![Tell Me About A Problem You Have Solved](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/46.JPG)

When dealing with these types of questions, we aim to employ a methodology known as the **SAR method**, which stands for **Situation**, **Action**, and **Result**.

**SAR** entails describing the Situation, the corresponding Action taken, and the ultimate Result achieved.

There's one additional aspect to consider, and that is you may encounter variations of this question, such as being asked to elaborate on an interesting project you've worked on. These variations are very similar in nature.

### <a name="weakness">What Is Your Biggest Weakness</a>
![weakness](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/48.JPG)

Often, when faced with a problem, I tend to immediately dive into coding without giving much thought to the underlying issue.

However, as I type away, I begin to realize the importance of patience. It occurs to me that I should have taken a moment to plan out my code, consider its structure, and define the specific problem I am addressing before rushing into the coding phase.

In light of this realization, I have recently adopted a more deliberate approach. Now, I make it a point to start by writing pseudocode. This involves outlining the steps I intend to take and commenting on the overall process. 

I carefully consider my assumptions about inputs and then proceed to articulate the sequential steps my code should follow. Only after this thorough planning phase do I actually start coding.

This shift in my workflow has proven beneficial, as it ensures a more thoughtful and structured development process. 

It allows me to approach coding with a clearer understanding of the problem at hand and results in more efficient and effective solutions.

### <a name="questions">Any Questions For Us?</a>

![Any Questions For Us](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/49.JPG)

**Question examples**:

- What is the greatest mistake you made in the first month of the job, and what did you do?

- Where do you see this company going in the next three years?

- Why did you join this company again?

- Have you seen your skills grow in the past year?

- What do they wish somebody told them when they just started the job at this company?

### Secret Weapon

![Secret Weapon](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/50.JPG)


#### Prioritizing Simplicity over Complexity:
Instead, you emphasized the importance of writing readable code. Your recognition that collaboration within a team involves ensuring code remains comprehensible and maintainable long after its initial creation is noteworthy. 

This perspective sets you apart, especially considering the rarity of such insight among individuals with only a few years of experience.

#### Avoiding Premature Optimization:
The phrase "Premature optimization is the root of all evil" underscores the wisdom of not overly focusing on optimizing code before it's necessary. 

This principle advocates for addressing performance concerns at the right time rather than prematurely, ensuring a balanced and efficient development process.

#### Maintaining an Overall Goal and Avoiding Myopic Focus:
Highlighting the importance of having an overarching goal and steering clear of myopic tendencies is crucial. 

Myopic focus can hinder progress by limiting one's perspective to a narrow scope. Acknowledging the broader objectives ensures a more comprehensive and forward-thinking approach to projects.

#### Handling Frustrations with Code:
Acknowledging challenges, such as dealing with clients' less-than-ideal code or potentially frustrating coworkers, is a realistic aspect of the job. 

It's essential to approach these situations with a constructive mindset, seeking solutions rather than dwelling on complaints. This demonstrates a proactive approach to problem-solving and team collaboration.

#### Embracing Humility and Team Dynamics:
Maintaining a humble attitude is critical in a collaborative coding environment. Your ability to refrain from complaining about others, coupled with a willingness to receive feedback and constructive criticism, showcases a team-oriented mentality. 

Recognizing that individual egos should not overshadow the collective goal of the company or project is a valuable trait that positions you as an asset within a development team. This perspective makes you not just a skilled coder but also a valuable team player, contributing to the success of the overall project.

### After The Interview

Well, first off, you want to thank your recruiter or the interviewer and you want to sound excited.

And you also want to ask them when you should expect to hear back from them so that you have some sort of a timeline of when the decision is going to be made, whether to give you the job or to do another interview.


![Thank you for your time](https://github.com/tsokac2/-_-_Data_Structures_Algorithms/blob/main/src/51.JPG)


Thank you for your time.

I'm sure you have lots of candidates to see, but I want to say one last thing.

There are no shortages of developers for you to interview.

However, there is a shortage of good, talented, egoless developers with ambition to learn.

It's not the ones that are unable to admit that they are wrong.

The best developers aren't the ones that know the language inside and out at the expense of having blinders.

It is not the ones who are unable to admit they are wrong.

I am not the most experienced developer that you may interview today, but the one thing that you can

guarantee is that there is nobody that you will interview that will work as hard to develop his or her

skill every day, play nicely with all the other developers at the company and isn't so narrow minded

and problem solving that he or she isn't willing to try new and novel ideas.

When you hire me, you will rest assured that you won't have to micromanage me.

You don't have to extinguish fires.

And in one year I'll be one of your most valuable employees.

I can guarantee that I am at a point in my career where I want to be surrounded by a team that I can

grow with and be surrounded by smart people like yourself.

And I've chosen this company specific for that reason.

And you've probably had similar experiences in your career where one company allows you to really have

an impact and propel your career.

I am at the stage now and I hope to be part of the team with you.

So thank you for your time and I hope to hear back soon from you.

All right.

That was it.

Now, this may sound a little intense, but who would you hire?
