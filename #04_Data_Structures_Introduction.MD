Data Structures In Different Languages

### <a name="data-structure">What Is A Data Structure?</a>
A data structure is a collection of values. The values can have relationships among them, and they can have functions apply to them.

Arrays and objects in JavaScript are each a form of a data structure that allows us to store information.

It refers to the logical or mathematical representation of data, as well as the implementation in a computer program. 

Data structures are essential for efficient program design, as they allow programmers to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a way that is both fast and easy to understand.

### How Computers Store Data

**CPU - Central Processing Unit**
- It is the brains of a computer, responsible for carrying out all the instructions that make your computer work. 
- The **CPU** is made up of several different components, including the control unit, the arithmetic logic unit (ALU), and the registers.

**RAM - Random access memory**

- Primary storage is the memory that is directly accessible by the computer's central processing unit (CPU). 
- It is typically volatile, meaning that it loses its contents when the computer is powered off. 


A data structure is an arrangement of data.
You can define the way you interact with this data and how it is arranged in RAM.
